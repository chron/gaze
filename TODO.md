OTHER STUFF

- BUG: When you use newlines in your message the ReactMarkdown component doesn't render them
- If we're going to take JSON directly in the modal, need some friendly errors
- Also the modal is too long with long JSON and files
- Tidy up old images from convex storage before regenerating
- Edit campaign upfront, navigate to it after creating
- Drop chat messages out of the pagination so you don't have to hard refresh to go back to 10.
- Compress older context using the summarisation action
- Track age of memories in case that's useful for tapering their importance off over time

DONE

- store tool calls along with other messages (string -> string[]? or more structured?)
- figure out if there's a better way to get the files in context
- Allow regenerating the last message
